# Software-Testing-Project

I used a C++ code and implemented automated tests using GTest - Visual Studio.
First, I had to revise the code using MISRA rules, then we had to create at least 15 automated tests to achieve 100% code coverage, using stubs and drivers, and different testing methods (positive/negative, equivalence classes/boundary testing).
Finally, we had to report the found issue in an Excel file that contained all the necessary information for identifying/reproducing it.
